# About Me

![That's me!](img/about/agr0.png)

Hello. My name is Dan. Or Agr0. Or Agr0_Dan, depending on what platform you are contacting me on.

I hack things for fun and prevent things from being hacked for profit. I also like yoyos and video games. I love sushi and ramen. I have the greatest family ever that supports me when I dedicate a good portion of the holidays towards the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge and the subsequent writeup. Special thanks to my daughter for cheering me on in my journey to saving Christmas for one and all.

You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/AgroDan) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/agr0dan).

I have [a website](https://agrohacksstuff.io).
