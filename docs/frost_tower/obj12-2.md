# Recon Stage

The website shows a countdown timer:

![Countdown to amazingness](/img/obj12-2/img1.png)

NOTE: You can see exactly when I did this challenge based on the countdown timer. As of this moment the countdown timer is zeroes across the board, but the timer was set for 12/25/21. Apparently nothing amazing ever came. Not from Jack Frost, anyway!

Based on reviewing the code, I have mapped out the following endpoints:

### No access necessary
- / - GET -- main site, shows countdown
- /testsite - GET -- apparently a test site.
- /testsite - POST -- Handles the "stay tuned" process.
- /contact - GET -- Shows a "Contact Us" page, asking for a full name, email, phone number and country.
- /postcontact - POST -- Handles that values submitted from the `/contact` endpoint.
- /login - GET -- A 'Sign in' page.
- /login - POST -- Performs the actual logging in
- /redirect - GET -- Bounces you to a login page if you aren't logged in.
- /forgotpass - GET -- Renders a "I forgot my password" page.
- /forgotpass - POST -- Handles submissions from the `/forgotpass` endpoint.
- /forgotpass/token/:id - GET -- I assume you can get a user's forgotten password here? (find out what a "token" is)
- /forgotpass/token/:id - POST -- Updates a user's password.

### A Session cookie is necessary

- /detail/:id - GET -- Allows me to view users that have filled out data on the `/contact` endpoint
- /edit/:id - GET -- Frontend to editing a user's data.
- /edit/:id - POST -- Handling of the updating of user's data
- /delete/:id - POST -- Deletes a user
- /search - GET -- Searches through users. Interesting...
- /search - POST -- Performs the actual searching
- /export - POST -- I think this dumps the entire `uniquecontact` database as an XML file
- /logout - GET -- destroys the session and bounces you to `/contact`.
- /dashboard - GET -- Displays the actual Dashboard
- /adduser - GET -- Frontend to adding a user, but ONLY if your userstatus == 1
- /adduser - POST -- Handles the adding of a user.
- /userlist - GET -- Frontend to displaying all users, but ONLY if your userstatus == 1
- /useredit/:id - GET -- Frontend to modifying a user, but ONLY if your userstatus == 1
- /useredit/:id - POST -- Handles the actual editing of a user. ALSO escapes XSS, just saying
- /userdelete/:id - POST -- Handles the deletion of a user.
