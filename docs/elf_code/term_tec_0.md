I was so looking forward to this challenge. Python baby!

The elf code!

## How to Play
The objective here is to use python to collect all the lollipops and return to the KringleCon entrance. Look out for munchkins and traps!

Use the console to move your elf in the game window. Use commands like

`elf.moveLeft(1)` or `elf.moveRight(2)` to move the elf around, collect the lollipops and reach the green circle found at the KringleCon entrance.

Sometimes you need to solve a python challenge to get past a Munchkin. To answer the challenge, use `munchkin.answer(answer)`. Just make sure you are within 1 grid square of a munchkin before submitting the answer.
